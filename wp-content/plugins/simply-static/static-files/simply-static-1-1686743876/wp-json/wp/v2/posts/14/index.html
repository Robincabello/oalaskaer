The government of the country has a novel plan to reduce this number. The Netherlands government will provide free sunscreen to the people of the country. As a result, it is believed that the risk of skin cancer can be greatly reduced even if exposed to direct sunlight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the official sources of the Netherlands, this summer, sunscreen will be distributed to the general public in all educational institutions, parks, sports centers, festivals etc. in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country&#8217;s government believes that the people of the Netherlands want to be guaranteed protection from direct sunlight. And for the purpose of ensuring this protection, efforts are being made to distribute sunscreen free of cost. One of the aims of this initiative is to ensure that no one is deprived of this protection due to economic reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to local media reports, a dermatologist of the country first brought forward such an initiative. According to him, sunscreen should be given to the common people to prevent skin cancer, just like sanitizers were given to common people during the Corona epidemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jako Knape, a resort consultant in the Netherlands, said that children should use sunscreen from an early age.
